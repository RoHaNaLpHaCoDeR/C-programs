MCD project

The Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) was the municipal corporation, an autonomous body that governed 8 of the 11 Districts of Delhi, in the union territory of Delhi, India. It was one of three municipalities in the National Capital Territory of Delhi, the others being New Delhi Municipal Council, and Delhi Cantonment Board. "The MCD was among the largest municipal bodies in the world providing civic services to more than estimated population of 11 million citizens in the capital city."[1] The municipal corporation covered an area of 1,397.3 km² (539.5 mi²).


Civic Centre (28 floor)located on Minto Road, New Delhi is the headquarters of Municipal Corporation of Delhi.
Within its jurisdiction were some of the most densely populated areas in the world. It also had the unique distinction of providing civic services to rural and urban villages, resettlement colonies, regularised unauthorised colonies, unregularised slum/squatter settlements, private 'katras' etc., all at the same time.

The Municipal Corporation of Delhi was replaced by three new bodies, the North Delhi Municipal Corporation, the South Delhi Municipal Corporation and the East Delhi Municipal Corporation in 2012. [2][3]
