GitHub is an American company that provides hosting for software development version control using Git. It is a subsidiary of Microsoft, which acquired the company in 2018 for $7.5 billion.[4] It offers all of the distributed version control and source code management (SCM) functionality of Git as well as adding its own features. It provides access control and several collaboration features such as bug tracking, feature requests, task management, and wikis for every project.[5]

GitHub offers plans for free, professional, and enterprise accounts.[6] Free GitHub accounts are commonly used to host open source projects.[7] As of January 2019, GitHub offers unlimited private repositories to all plans, including free accounts.[8] As of May 2019, GitHub reports having over 37 million users[9] and more than 100 million repositories[10] (including at least 28 million public repositories),[11] making it the largest host of source code in the world.[12]

GitHub at AWS Summit
GitHub was developed by Chris Wanstrath, P. J. Hyett, Tom Preston-Werner and Scott Chacon using Ruby on Rails, and started in February 2008. The company, GitHub, Inc., has existed since 2007 and is located in San Francisco.[13]


The shading of the map illustrates the number of users as a proportion of each country's Internet population. The circular charts surrounding the two hemispheres depict the total number of GitHub users (left) and commits (right) per country.
On February 24, 2009, GitHub team members announced, in a talk at Yahoo! headquarters, that within the first year of being online, GitHub had accumulated over 46,000 public repositories, 17,000 of which were formed in the previous month alone. At that time, about 6,200 repositories had been forked at least once and 4,600 had been merged.

On July 5, 2009, GitHub announced that the site was being harnessed by over 100,000 users. On July 27, 2009, in another talk delivered at Yahoo!, Preston-Werner announced that GitHub had grown to host 90,000 unique public repositories, 12,000 having been forked at least once, for a total of 135,000 repositories.[14]

On July 25, 2010, GitHub announced that it was hosting 1 million repositories.[15] On April 20, 2011, GitHub announced that it was hosting 2 million repositories.[16]

On June 2, 2011, ReadWriteWeb reported that GitHub had surpassed SourceForge and Google Code in total number of commits for the period of January to May 2011.[17]

On July 9, 2012, Peter Levine, general partner at GitHub investor Andreessen Horowitz, stated that GitHub had been growing revenue at 300% annually since 2008 "profitably nearly the entire way".[18]

On January 16, 2013, GitHub announced it had passed the 3 million users mark and was then hosting more than 5 million repositories.[19] On December 23, 2013, GitHub announced it had reached 10 million repositories.[20]

In June 2015, GitHub opened an office in Japan that is its first office outside of the U.S.[21]

On July 29, 2015, GitHub announced it had raised $250 million in funding in a round led by Sequoia Capital. The round valued the company at approximately $2 billion.[22]

In 2016, GitHub was ranked No. 14 on the Forbes Cloud 100 list.[23]

On February 28, 2018, GitHub fell victim to the second largest distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack in history, with incoming traffic reaching a peak of about 1.35 terabits per second.[24]

On June 4, 2018, Microsoft announced it had reached an agreement to acquire GitHub for $7.5 billion.[25] The purchase closed on October 26, 2018.[26]

On June 19, 2018, GitHub expanded its GitHub Education by offering free education bundles to all schools.[27][28]

Acquisition by Microsoft
On June 4, 2018, Microsoft announced its intent to acquire GitHub for US$7.5 billion, and the deal closed on October 26, 2018.[29] GitHub will continue to operate independently as a community, platform and business. Under Microsoft, the service will be led by Xamarin's Nat Friedman, reporting to Scott Guthrie, executive vice president of Microsoft Cloud and AI. Current CEO Chris Wanstrath will be retained as a "technical fellow", also reporting to Guthrie. Microsoft had become a significant user of GitHub, using it to host open source projects and development tools such as Chakra Core, PowerShell, Visual Studio Code, and Windows Terminal and has backed other open source projects such as Linux, and developed Virtual File System for Git (VFS for Git; formerly Git Virtual File System or GVFS)â€”a Git extension for managing large-scale repositories (and itself has been adopted by GitHub).[25][30]

There have been concerns from developers Kyle Simpson, JavaScript trainer and author, and Rafael Laguna, CEO at Open-Xchange over Microsoft's purchase, citing uneasiness over Microsoft's handling of previous acquisitions, such as Nokia's mobile business or Skype.[31][32]

Some[who?] saw this as a culmination of Microsoft's recent changes in business strategy under CEO Satya Nadella, which has seen a larger focus on the sale of cloud computing services as its main line of business, alongside development of and contributions to open source software (such as Linux), as opposed to the Microsoft Windows operating system.[33][4][30] Harvard Business Review argued that Microsoft was intending to acquire GitHub to get access to its userbase, so it can be used as a loss leader to encourage use of its other development products and services.[34]

Concerns over the sale bolstered interest in competitors: Bitbucket (owned by Atlassian), GitLab (a commercial open source product that also runs a hosted service version) and SourceForge (owned by BIZX, LLC) reported that they had seen spikes in new users intending to migrate projects from GitHub to their respective services.[35][36][37][38]
The following list illustrates the importance the C programming language, in no particular order:

The C language is small and relatively easy to learn.
1.C compilers can produce highly efficient code.
2.C compilers and cross-compilers are widely available for a large array of hardware targets, from tiny eight-bit microcontrollers to giant mainframes. The availability of compilers enables highly portable source code to be written, when appropriate disciplines are followed.
3.C, although it is a high-level language, provides access to some fundamental low-level concepts such as memory addresses and dynamic memory management - concepts that are hidden by many other languages.
4.C has been used to implement (in whole or in part) several major operating systems and kernels, including Unix, Linux, MacOS, and Windows.
5.C has been used to implement (in whole or in part) runtime environments supporting execution of platform-independent code (e.g., the Java Virtual Machine, the .NET CLR, etc.).
6.C is often used to implement efficient libraries for less-efficient languages. For example, many libraries for Python are implemented in C.
7.Compilers and interpreters for a wide variety of programming languages have been written in C.
8.C remains the most popular programming language for programming microcontrollers in embedded systems.
9.C has influenced the following programming languages: PHP, C++, LPC, Perl, Vala, Objective-C, PCASTL, AWK, JavaScript, Limbo, D, C#, MOO, SISAL, Pike, ECMAScript, Joy, C--, Ferite, Yoix, ColdC, Aikido Programming Language, Nickle, BitC, Processing, NWScript, SAC programming language, Vala, Kaya, MIVA Script, Corba IDL, QuakeC, S-Lang, Cilk, Unified Parallel C, Split-C, Claire, VisSim, Java, Go, AMPL, Alpoca, Draco, S, Alef, Game Maker Language, BAIL
